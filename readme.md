# Chain iOS Wallet Demo

A Touch ID iOS Bitcoin wallet built on the [Chain API](https://chain.com).

## Summary
This open source Bitcoin wallet uses the iOS 8 Touch ID API to securely store your private key in your Apple Keychain, which can only be accessed with your fingerprint.

Fork it and build something great! 

## Installation
Chain Wallet uses the [Chain API iOS SDK](https://github.com/chain-engineering/chain-ios) and [CoreBitcoin](https://github.com/oleganza/CoreBitcoin), both included as CocoaPods.

To install, first run:
```
pod install
```

Then open the workspace file in XCode:
```
Chain Wallet.xcworkspace
```

Finally, get a Chain API token at [Chain.com](https://chain.com) and define the following in CNAppDelegate.m:
```
[Chain sharedInstanceWithToken:@"{YOUR-API-TOKEN}"];  
```

## Requirements
Chain Wallet requires iOS 8 and Touch ID (currently available on the iPhone 5s).
